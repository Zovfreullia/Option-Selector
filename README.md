# Option Selector

#### Summary 

This is an application that allows you to select your own video game from a genre you've selected on the previous screen. When you select a catergory or genre of games, for example, horror, adventure, or shooter, then it will take you to another screen. This new screen is a UITableViewController with a list of different games from that selected genere. Once a cell is tapped, a checkmark will appear on the right side of the cell, and tapping on another cell will remove the previous checkmark and show the new checkmark on the selected cell. Navigating back on the 'root' view controller that list the categories will now show the game corresponding to the cell.
